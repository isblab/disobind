[Evidence global]=Evidence suggests that the E7-CR3 domain would not be able to maintain this tertiary structure in monomeric form or in the absence of zinc coordination and is, therefore, likely to be an obligate and zinc-dependent dimer (PMID:16249186). This is consistent with solution studies showing that HPV-E7 undergoes a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of about 1 μm (PMID:11123931).

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:12954645). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:18850724). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:16770013). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:15619638). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=Detailed thermodynamic and spectroscopic studies were carried out on the ColE1-ROP protein in order to establish a quantitative basis for the contribution of noncovalent interactions to the stability of four-helix-bundle proteins. The energetics of both heat- and GdnHCl-induced denaturation were measured by differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC) and/or by following the change in circular dichroism in the far-UV range. No intermediate species could be detected during thermal unfolding of the dimer in the absence of GdnHCl. Under these conditions ROP unfolding exhibits a strict two-state behavior (PMID:8471599).

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions as evidenced by the presence of a ZapA domain (Pfam PF05164.10, PMID:25002581). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805).

[Evidence global]=Histones form parts of the nucleosome particle by dimerization and subsequent multimerization (PMID:1946434). The dimer contains both histone subunits in a highly intertwined conformation reflecting the possible domain-swapped origins of the structure (PMID:17391511). Accordingly, this dimerization has been experimentally characterized to be coupled to the structure formation of both interacting partners (PMID:12779337); this synergistic folding has been shown separately for H2A-H2B dimers (PMID:15588829) and H3-H4 dimers as well (PMID:15096635). Histones containing various types of monomeric subunits can exhibit varying stability and folding kinetics. E.g. in the case of H3-H4 histones, the dimerization is a complex process with the two monomers first adopting an intermediate state upon encounter and then reaching the classical histone fold through restructurization (PMID:12779337). However, independent of composition and folding kinetics, all histones appear to fold in a cooperative fashion that is coupled to binding (PMID:11669650).

[Evidence global]=Histones form parts of the nucleosome particle by dimerization and subsequent multimerization (PMID:1946434). The dimer contains both histone subunits in a highly intertwined conformation reflecting the possible domain-swapped origins of the structure (PMID:17391511). Accordingly, this dimerization has been experimentally characterized to be coupled to the structure formation of both interacting partners (PMID:12779337); this synergistic folding has been shown separately for H2A-H2B dimers (PMID:15588829) and H3-H4 dimers as well (PMID:15096635). Histones containing various types of monomeric subunits can exhibit varying stability and folding kinetics. E.g. in the case of H3-H4 histones, the dimerization is a complex process with the two monomers first adopting an intermediate state upon encounter and then reaching the classical histone fold through restructurization (PMID:12779337). However, independent of composition and folding kinetics, all histones appear to fold in a cooperative fashion that is coupled to binding (PMID:11669650).

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions. Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure. Leucine zippers, phenylalanine zippers and alanine zippers are subclasses of coiled coils where the hydrophobic interactions between subunits are predominantly formed by leucine, phenylalanine or alanine residues, respectively.

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:9680483). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure. Leucine zippers, phenylalanine zippers and alanine zippers are subclasses of coiled coils where the hydrophobic interactions between subunits are predominantly formed by leucine, phenylalanine or alanine residues, respectively.

[Evidence global]=The subunits of the dimer were shown to be disordered in their monomeric form with the structure arising as a result of the interaction (PMID:11018027).

Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked.

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:18767159). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=The structure shows the core domain of a SNARE complex (PMID:12496247). SNARE complexes are formed by the parallel arrangement of four protein chains bound by coiled-coil interactions forming a four helix bundle (PMID:9390521). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=Centromere proteins S and X (CENP-S and CENP-X), also called MHF1 and MHF2 form histone-like heterodimers (PMID:20347428). These dimers further associate with heterodimers formed by CENP-T and CENP-W and these tetrameric structures share a high degree of similarity with canonical histone multimers within the nucleosome (PMID:22304917). CENP-T-W-S-X tetramers - similarly to nucleosomes formed by histones - are able to bind and supercoil DNA (PMID:24234442). Apart from some structural differences leading to different functions (e.g. CENP-T-W-S-X tetramers show a preference for branched DNA as opposed to nucleosomes, PMID:24390579), both the overall and the underlying basic structures of nucleosomes and CENP-T-W-S-X tetramers are essentially the same with both CENP-S/CENP-X and CENP-T/W dimers forming structures nearly identical to that of histone dimers (PMID:20347428 and PMID:19070575). Histone dimerization has been experimentally characterized to be coupled to the structure formation of both interacting partners (PMID:12779337); this synergistic folding has been shown separately for various histone dimers (PMID:15588829, PMID:15096635).

[Evidence global]=Centromere proteins S and X (CENP-S and CENP-X), also called MHF1 and MHF2 form histone-like heterodimers (PMID:20347428). These dimers further associate with heterodimers formed by CENP-T and CENP-W and these tetrameric structures share a high degree of similarity with canonical histone multimers within the nucleosome (PMID:22304917). CENP-T-W-S-X tetramers - similarly to nucleosomes formed by histones - are able to bind and supercoil DNA (PMID:24234442). Apart from some structural differences leading to different functions (e.g. CENP-T-W-S-X tetramers show a preference for branched DNA as opposed to nucleosomes, PMID:24390579), both the overall and the underlying basic structures of nucleosomes and CENP-T-W-S-X tetramers are essentially the same with both CENP-S/CENP-X and CENP-T/W dimers forming structures nearly identical to that of histone dimers (PMID:20347428 and PMID:19070575). Histone dimerization has been experimentally characterized to be coupled to the structure formation of both interacting partners (PMID:12779337); this synergistic folding has been shown separately for various histone dimers (PMID:15588829, PMID:15096635). Histones containing various types of monomeric subunits can exhibit varying stability and folding kinetics; however, independent of composition and folding kinetics, all histones appear to fold in a cooperative fashion that is coupled to binding (PMID:11669650).

[Evidence global]=While the C-terminal region of p53 from humans and D. melanogaster do not share a high degree of sequential identity, they are structurally and functionally similar (PMID:10778859). The oligomerization domain (OD) of D. melanogaster p53 (Dmp53) includes the structural elements of that of human p53 exhibiting a four-helix bundle structure bound by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (PMID:8023159). Human p53 tetramer is formed as a dimer of dimers and follows a two state folding and binding process, demonstrated in several chemical and thermal denaturation/refolding experiments (PMID:9582268,PMID:18410249,PMID:19913028). The main difference between the two p53 variants are the additional structural elements in Dmp53 OD which comprise an additional helix and a beta-strand. The deletion of these structural elements destabilize the oligomer hinting at a suboptimal binding of the core structural elements compared to the human counterpart (PMID:17581633).

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:15526038). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=The interacting chains form a ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) structure (PMID:17007877). These structures in general have been described with the two monomers adopting a stable conformation upon the interaction (PMID:17676053). The hydrophobic core stabilizing the complex is formed by both interactors and is thus absent prior to the interaction (PMID:25713077).

[Evidence global]=The hexameric NDP kinase from Dictyostelium discoideum displays one single, irreversible differential scanning calorimetry peak (Tm=62°C) over a broad protein concentration, indicating a single step denaturation. However, the P105G substitution, which affects a loop implicated in subunit contacts, yields a protein that reversibly dissociates to folded monomers at 38°C before the irreversible denaturation occurs (Tm=47°C). These data indicate a “coupling” of the quaternary structure with the tertiary structure in the wild-type, but not in the mutated protein (PMID:8663370).

[Evidence global]=CD measurements and a global analysis decomposition of the time-resolved fluorescence decay over denaturant concentration shows the presence of an intermediate in the unfolding of human SOD by guanidinium hydrochloride. Considering previous measurements of partially denatured HSOD as a function of protein concentration (PMID:1510915), these results strongly suggest that the unfolding intermediate is a monomer that displays a molten globule state (PMID:8298055).

[Evidence global]=The unfolding of pig liver 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase by urea has been investigated at equilibrium. Unfolding of the enzyme was monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The steepness of the fluorescence and CD changes between 2 and 8 M urea, and the lack of any discernible plateau suggests that unfolding of the protein is a cooperative process. The unfolding of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase as a function of urea concentration was monitored by fluorescence measurements of the tryptophanyl residues. The kinetic results indicate that the aminotransferase unfolds in a single kinetic phase (PMID:8075151).

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:16365313). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=Various dimeric members of neurotrophic factors (including human/mouse nerve growth factor, human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5)) have been shown to fold and dimerize at the same time via a two-state process (PMID:8161524). While the members of this family show a significant variance in sequence, they adopt a highly similar structure upon binding and behave almost identically in unfolding/refolding experiments. Thus the two-state folding/binding nature seems to be a hallmark of NGF and closely related proteins.

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:26795465). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=p63 and p73 are members of the p53 protein family. The tetramerization region of p53, p63 and p73 are closely homologous to each other, having very similar sequences, structures and biological functions (PMID:25185827,PMID:18289041,PMID:20379196), all containing the same Pfam domain (PF07710). The tetramerization domain of p53 exhibits a four-helix bundle structure bound by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (PMID:8023159). The tetramer is formed as a dimer of dimers and follows a two state folding and binding process, demonstrated in several chemical and thermal denaturation/refolding experiments (PMID:9582268,PMID:18410249,PMID:19913028).

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:11438684). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.

[Evidence global]=p53, p63, p73 and their homologues are all members of the p53 protein family. The tetramerization region of p53, p63 and p73 are closely homologous to each other, having very similar sequences, structures and biological functions (PMID:25185827,PMID:18289041,PMID:20379196), all containing the same Pfam domain (PF07710). The tetramerization domain of p53 exhibits a four-helix bundle structure bound by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (PMID:8023159). The tetramer is formed as a dimer of dimers and follows a two state folding and binding process, demonstrated in several chemical and thermal denaturation/refolding experiments (PMID:9582268,PMID:18410249,PMID:19913028).

[Evidence global]=Histones form parts of the nucleosome particle by dimerization and subsequent multimerization (PMID:1946434). The dimer contains both histone subunits in a highly intertwined conformation reflecting the possible domain-swapped origins of the structure (PMID:17391511). Accordingly, this dimerization has been experimentally characterized to be coupled to the structure formation of both interacting partners (PMID:12779337); this synergistic folding has been shown separately for H2A-H2B dimers (PMID:15588829) and H3-H4 dimers as well (PMID:15096635). Histones containing various types of monomeric subunits can exhibit varying stability and folding kinetics. E.g. in the case of H3-H4 histones, the dimerization is a complex process with the two monomers first adopting an intermediate state upon encounter and then reaching the classical histone fold through restructurization (PMID:12779337). However, independent of composition and folding kinetics, all histones appear to fold in a cooperative fashion that is coupled to binding (PMID:11669650).

[Evidence global]=The interacting chains form a ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) structure (PMID:17001030). These structures in general have been described with the two monomers adopting a stable conformation upon the interaction (PMID:17676053). The hydrophobic core stabilizing the complex is formed by both interactors and is thus absent prior to the interaction (PMID:25713077).

[Evidence global]=The subunits in the structure are bound via coiled coil interactions (PMID:16698550). Coiled coils are highly versatile folding units (PMID:11166216), where the formation of the structure and the interaction between subunits is almost ubiquitously linked. This cooperative nature of binding and folding that results in a two-step process has been demonstrated for coiled coils with varying oligomeric state from dimers (PMID:9811815) and trimers (PMID:10933510) up to heptamers (PMID:17030805). While the interaction and folding are linked, in certain cases there can be significant residual structure before association (PMID:8401212). However, these residual structural elements usually encompass 1-2 turns of helices that serve as a 'nucleation site' driving interaction and helix formation (zipping up) (PMID:17438295), thus even in these cases monomeric coiled coil subunits cannot be considered to have a stable structure.
